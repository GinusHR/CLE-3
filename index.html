    <h2>Info</h2>
    <p> What's with these homies, dissing my girl?
        Why do they gotta front?
        What did we ever do to these guys
        That made them so violent?
        Woo-hoo
        But you know I'm yours
        Woo-hoo
        And I know you're mine
        Woo-hoo
        (And that's for all time)
        Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
        Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
        I don't care what they say about us anyway
        I don't care about that
        Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
        I know that you need help
        Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
        You need a guardian </p>
